# Beginner Level Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing data visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to explore different types of plots, understand their use cases, and visually analyze data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.

## Objectives
- To understand the fundamentals of data visualization in Python  
- To learn and implement various plots using Matplotlib  
- To explore advanced statistical visualizations using Seaborn  
- To compare Matplotlib and Seaborn based on flexibility, usage, and aesthetics  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- NumPy  
- Pandas

## Methodology
1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Generated or loaded datasets for visualization  
3. Created multiple plots using Matplotlib for basic visualization  
4. Implemented advanced and statistical plots using Seaborn  
5. Saved and analyzed visual outputs for interpretation  

## Visualizations Implemented

### Matplotlib
- Line Chart  
- Bar Graph  
- Histogram  
- Scatter Plot  
- Pie Chart  
- Area Chart (fill_between and stackplot)  

### Seaborn
- Line Plot  
- Bar Plot  
- Count Plot  
- Box Plot  
- Histogram (Histplot)  
- KDE Plot  
- Heatmap  
- Regression Plot  

## Results
The project demonstrates how different visualization techniques help in understanding data distribution, trends, correlations, and comparisons. Seaborn provides cleaner aesthetics and statistical insights, while Matplotlib offers detailed control and customization.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with Python visualization libraries  
- Understood when to use specific plots based on data type  
- Learned differences between low-level and high-level visualization libraries  
- Improved ability to interpret visual data insights  

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my foundation in data visualization by combining theory with practical implementation. It enhanced my analytical skills and improved my ability to communicate insights visually, which is essential in data science and analytics roles.
